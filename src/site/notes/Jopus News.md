# 📦 News Wiki 

You are now a native English translator. Please help me translate the following text into English:

[[News Wiki\|News Wiki]] is a personal knowledge base built on GitHub based on the Zettelkästen method. In this knowledge base, I record everything I know, including reading notes, knowledge summaries, and note-taking.

## 💡 Why build a personal knowledge base?

For me, the reasons for building a personal knowledge base are as follows:

- **Systematically organize knowledge**: Integrate scattered knowledge points into a systematic knowledge system, which is easier to understand and remember.
- **Easily find information**: When you need to find a knowledge point or note, you can directly search in the knowledge base, without having to look for it in various notebooks.
- **Easily share and communicate**: You can share your knowledge base with others, and also communicate your opinions and thoughts with others.

## 🗒️ Zettelkästen method

Zettelkästen is a note-taking method based on a box of small paper cards as the core. It was proposed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The core of this method is to classify and find the notes by dividing them into different types and organizing the learned knowledge into small modules. This article will introduce the specific practice of the Zettelkästen method.

### 📦 Box types

The Zettelkästen method uses two types of boxes:

1. Bibliographic card box (bibliographic slip-box) - used to store literature notes
2. Main card box (main slip-box) - used to store permanent notes, index cards and project cards

### 📝 Note types

The Zettelkästen method uses the following four types of notes:

1. Literature notes (literature notes) - During reading, paraphrase the content to the card, and write the literature reference information on the back of the card
