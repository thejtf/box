But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. So we need to be true to who we are and remember what’s really important to us.

# 🌲 Thinking Tree

In this forest, each of my thoughts is a tree, growing from a sapling to maturity and even withering away. I record the [[Maturity Levels\|Maturity Levels]] of developing an idea by the stages of its growth.
