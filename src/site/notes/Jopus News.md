But somehow, in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species our deep appreciation. So we need to be true to who we are and remember what’s really important to us.



# 📰 News Wiki 

[[News Wiki\|News Wiki]] is my personal knowledge repository built on GitHub based on the Zettelkästen method. In this knowledge repo[^1], I record everything my thoughts, including `book excerpt`, `knowledge`,`summaries` and `flash mind`.


# 🌲 Thinking Tree

In this forest, each of my thoughts is a tree, growing from a sapling to maturity and even withering away. I record the [[Maturity Levels\|Maturity Levels]] of developing an idea by the stages of its growth.


# ✍️ English Writing
This is an English composition project. Through this project, I aim to hone my English writing skills. I believe there is no means of expression that is more profound, more composed or freer than writing.
