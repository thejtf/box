## 🌳数字森林

[[数字森林\|数字森林]]是我的个人数字卡片盒，方法是基于德国社会学家卢曼的卡片盒笔记法Zettelkasten。[^2], I record everything in my thoughts, including `书摘`, `知识`,`总结` 和 `闪念`.


## 🪴 Thinking Tree

In this park, each of my thoughts is a tree, growing from a seeding to maturity and even withering away. I record the [[Maturity Levels\|Maturity Levels]] of developing an idea by the stages of its growth.


## ✍️ English Writing

This is an English composition project. Through this project, I aim to hone my English writing skills. I believe there is no means of expression that is more profound, more composed or freer than writing.
