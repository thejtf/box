## 🌳Wiki Park

[[Wiki Park\|Wiki Park]] is my digital park based on the Zettelkästen method. In this knowledge repo[^2], I record everything in my thoughts, including `book excerpt`, `knowledge`,`summaries` and `flash mind`.


## 🪴 Thinking Tree

In this park, each of my thoughts is a tree, growing from a seeding to maturity and even withering away. I record the [[Maturity Levels\|Maturity Levels]] of developing an idea by the stages of its growth.


## ✍️ English Writing

This is an English composition project. Through this project, I aim to hone my English writing skills. I believe there is no means of expression that is more profound, more composed or freer than writing.

[^1]: This verse is derived from [[Socrates\|Socrates]].
[^2]: Here, I'm using the word repo in place of the word [repository].
