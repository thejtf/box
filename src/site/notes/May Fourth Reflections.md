#### May Fourth Reflections

A hundred years have passed since the May Fourth Movement, but looking at it today, it seems as if nothing has changed.  

However, regardless of whether we agree or not, this world will eventually belong to the youth. 

Recently, some young people have developed a twisted ideology of "all people are equal above me and distinction among the classes below me". Such a distorted ideology does not seem to have a future.  

I don't know if this is an education issue or a social issue. Many problems of young people have not been properly discussed and resolved, but young people should not be blamed for their resentment. This is an era full of choices but no opportunities. 

Human desire will expand. This is no longer an era when people will be satisfied after a meal. People have different needs, and we should all think about what has made this generation become the way they are.  

Our society has never respected young people. We only tell young people what they should do. In the end, they have neither become what the previous generation wanted them to become nor become what they want to become.


#### Advice for Youth

Independent rather than servile [^1]
Progressive rather than conservative[^2]
Enterprising rather than reclusive[^3]
Worldly rather than isolationist[^4]
Practical rather than empty talk[^5]
Scientific rather than imaginary[^6]


[^1]:One should have the ability to think independently rather than follow others blindly. Analyze things based on one's own knowledge, wisdom and insights, pursue freedom, independence and equality.
[^2]:The times are constantly changing and developing. Our culture cannot remain unchanged. We must keep innovating and keep up with the trend of the times. Otherwise, we will become outdated and eliminated by the world.
[^3]:For people who are reclusive, in a good sense they can be called literati, but in a bad sense they can be called escapists avoiding reality. Now in troubled times, how can we allow escape? We should explore like Columbus and fight evil forces to revive the country and bring hope to the nation.
[^4]:The current international situation is closely linked. Even powerful countries cannot ignore diplomacy. Absorbing and learning from the system and experience of other countries has become a trend. If our country continues to insist on self-sufficiency, what we achieve may not necessarily suit social development and the current world.
[^5]:Europe advocates experimental philosophy, starting from life and connecting with reality. However, our country advocates empty words like courtesy, righteousness, loyalty and filial piety without focusing on life and reality. No matter how well said, it cannot save the people.
[^6]:To get rid of ignorance, we must believe in science, respect reason rather than imagination. Young people today should practice and be scientific instead of relying on imagination to save the country in order to succeed.Â
