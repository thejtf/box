Lately, I've been familiar with three ideas. One is from the book **[[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins\|God Delusion]]** by *Richard Dawkins*. He argued that, maybe religion is a side effect of another evolutionary traits which enables us to *maybe* work as a team. Then *Yuval Noah Harari* introduced me to the **knowledge illusion** in his book **[[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/21 Lessons for the 21st Century by Yuval Noah Harari\|21 Lessons for the 21st Century]]**, which enable us to believe to know something which we don't know personally but maybe known to someone somewhere. And in **[[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker\|Denial of Death]]** *Ernest Becker* explained that, Sigmund Freud did a great work on how people rather blindly follow people in [[Personal/Reading/Books/Read/Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego by Sigmund Freud\|a book]] ~~(I have to read that)~~. It is their urge to follow someone, to feel secure, like in the arms of their parents.

Now, I wonder, are they somehow connected in the depth of our biology? Is it some just different manifestation of same psychological condition? It can be. The blind belief that I know, or my God/Leader is right somehow looks emotionally similar to me.
