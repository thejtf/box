A few years back, I have an encounter with _[Ensō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%C5%8D)_ a distinctive form of art found amongst the Zen practitioners. To create one, one have to free his body from mind and draw a circle in ideally one stroke (or two sometimes). It can be either an open or a close circle, and they mean different things. While this art form is not exactly contemporary, but it is modern in the sense that it negates the interpretative aspect of art criticism.[^1] Meditation plays far much greater role here than the technics of producing the art.

This led me to an idea to build a Generative Art based on Ensō which I named [CyberEnsō](https://enso.utsob.me/).

### How does it work?
To draw an Ensō, one must _free one's mind of thoughts_, then _let one's body take control_, and _allow it to create a circle— momentous, signifying the phenomenon of life itself instead of a conscious intention_.

CyberEnsō can be considered a mean to do so. One have to free one's mind of thought and CyberEnsō takes that thought as the input. Then, it **[hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)** it, which is a destructive process, adds some randomness with it and produces a unique circle. The computer here is just like a calligraphy brush. With the hashing and randomness, a body in [mu-shin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushin_(mental_state)) state has as much control over it as it has on a brush.

[^1]: The practice of drawing Ensō is a part of [Hitsuzendō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitsuzend%C5%8D#Philosophical_background) or the 'Way of Zen through brush'.
