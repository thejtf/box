Now with the help of algorithm recommendation, what do people like? Social media produces what.

Whatever people like, social media provides.

So what do people like?

Or in other words, what do people produce, what does social media accept?

Then what is the most contagious? Virus, no, it's emotion. 

So when a platform has free flow of information, it eventually becomes a shelter for emotions, or even more extreme, a "cesspool". Because emotions do not have much value, but emotions are a very good medium for conveying information. 

For a message to be read and spread by more people, it must carry the pass of emotion. Why do live broadcasters shout loudly? Because they need to arouse the emotions and passion of the audience to place orders. Touching posts are forwarded thousands of times because people are moved. Short videos are liked because they make people laugh.

The Internet is a great invention of mankind, and the comment section of social media is indeed the worst invention of mankind. Playing jokes, twitching, mutual spraying, and moving belong to the comment area. Because there is not much motivation for other comments.

When everything becomes data visualization, knowledge that is serious and emotionless without data will eventually become trafficless.

Humans are animals that not only need food, but also information. The former shapes our body, the latter shapes our soul. 

Eating unhealthy food will make us sick, enduring too much emotion will exhaust us and drive us crazy.

So modern rock music was born, rock music is a rebellion and a vent.

We all know what is healthy to eat, but we can't help eating junk food. We also know what is more nutritious to watch, but we can't help staring at the screen.

Human nature is a bundle of desires. Dissatisfaction is painful, satisfaction is boring, and each person fluctuates between pain and boredom after satisfaction.

After so many years of social media, for the first time I feel that all this may be meaningless, page views are meaningless, forwards are meaningless, and comment counts are even more meaningless. 

In fact, people do not need to find meaning on social media.

High places are hard to stay, there is a tendency to fall in this world, and no one can stop it. 

However, in the end, the audience is satisfied but the self is lost.
