#### ‚úçÔ∏èReviews
This is a good beginner's guide to philosophy. It covers several different areas of philosophy with information from several prominent philosophers. 
I don't really know much about philosophy so I can't give you an in depth review. Philosophy tends to raise more questions then it answers I'm finding. There are lots of questions for the reader to answer and ponder over. 
The book actually makes me want to do further reading and research, so that's nice.
