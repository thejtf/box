## ‚úçÔ∏è Introduction

[[Tiger Wiki\|Tiger Wiki]] is a diatal forest based on the Zettelk√§sten method. In this knowledge repo, I record everything I know, including reading notes, knowledge summaries, note-taking ect.

## üêØ Why such a named for it?
Because my grandfather often called me "litter siberian tiger", so in memory of my grandfather who passed away long ago, I call this wiki `Tiger Wiki`. As we know, The tiger has no friends in forest, the tiger only needs a forest. Each of my ideas is a seed. Here is the forest composed of my ideas. So I named it `Jopus Forest`.

## üí° Why build a personal knowledge base?

For me, the reasons for building a personal knowledge repo are as follows:

- **Systematically organize knowledge**: Integrate scattered knowledge points into a systematic knowledge system, which is easier to understand and remember.
- **Easily find information**: When you need to find a knowledge point or note, you can directly search in the knowledge base, without having to look for it in various notebooks.
- **Easily share and communicate**: You can share your knowledge base with others, and also communicate your opinions and thoughts with others.

## üóíÔ∏è Zettelk√§sten method

Zettelk√§sten is a note-taking method based on a box of small paper cards as the core. It was proposed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The core of this method is to classify and find the notes by dividing them into different types and organizing the learned knowledge into small modules.
