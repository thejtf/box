## üêØTiger Wiki 

[[Tiger Wiki\|Tiger Wiki]] is my digital forest based on the Zettelk√§sten method. In this knowledge repo[^2], I record everything in my thoughts, including `book excerpt`, `knowledge`,`summaries` and `flash mind`.


## üå≤ Thinking Tree

In this forest, each of my thoughts is a tree, growing from a sapling to maturity and even withering away. I record the [[Maturity Levels\|Maturity Levels]] of developing an idea by the stages of its growth.


## ‚úçÔ∏è English Writing

This is an English composition project. Through this project, I aim to hone my English writing skills. I believe there is no means of expression that is more profound, more composed or freer than writing.

[^1]: Siegfried Sassoon was perhaps the most innocent of the war poets. This verse is derived from his poem [In Me, Past, Present, Future meet](https://allpoetry.com/In-Me,-Past,-Present,-Future-meet).
