#### Reflections

A hundred years have passed since the May Fourth Movement, but looking at it today, it seems as if nothing has changed.  

However, regardless of whether we agree or not, this world will eventually belong to the youth. 

Recently, some young people have developed a twisted ideology of "all people are equal above me and distinction among the classes below me". Such a distorted ideology does not seem to have a future.  

I don't know if this is an education issue or a social issue. Many problems of young people have not been properly discussed and resolved, but young people should not be blamed for their resentment. This is an era full of choices but no opportunities. 

Human desire will expand. This is no longer an era when people will be satisfied after a meal. People have different needs, and we should all think about what has made this generation become the way they are.  

Our society has never respected young people. We only tell young people what they should do. In the end, they have neither become what the previous generation wanted them to become nor become what they want to become.
